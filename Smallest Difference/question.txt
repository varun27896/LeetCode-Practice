Write a function that takes in two non empty unsorted arrays and returns the pairs of numbers 
whose absolute difference is closest to zero and returns and array containing these two numbers,
with the number from the first array in the first position and the number from the second array in
the second position.

Input:
arrayone = [-1,10,20,5,3,28]
arraytwo = [26,135,134,17,15]

Output:
[28,26]
